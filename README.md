- 👋 Hello, I am Jason Hendrickson. "A" is for my missing puppy. We were going to run a half-marathon this year.
- 👀 I’m interested in the scientific approach and scientific methodologies of Computer Science, Philosophy, Chemistry, and Engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to focus and concentrate on school through my headaches/migraines and other obstancles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an open array of topics. I don't want to shut any opportunity down, before I even know that I have an interest.
- 📫 How to reach me ... jhendrickson6@ivytech.edu
